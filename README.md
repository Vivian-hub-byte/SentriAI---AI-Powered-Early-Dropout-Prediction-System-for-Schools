# SentriAI - AI-Powered Early Student Dropout Prediction System
SentriAI is an AI-driven system designed to predict and mitigate early student dropout rates in educational institutions. By leveraging machine learning, SentriAI identifies at-risk students, enabling proactive interventions to improve overall student retention.

This MVP was built using a no code/low-code stack - **Lovable, Glide/Airtable AI, Mockaroo/CHatGPT synthetic data,** and optional **Figma UI enhancemnets.** It includes a functional prototype, predictive stimulation, structured dashboards and polished design assests suitable for demos or pitch presentations.
